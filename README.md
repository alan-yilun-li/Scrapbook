# Scrapbook

-------

Scrapbooks is a secure photo-journal app -- all your intimate photos and captions, your daily ramblings, are saved on your device and your device only. 

Log your day in a way that's truly and completely yours. 

### Features: 

##### Touch ID Support 
Lock your photos of you and your friends drinking behind your phone's Touch ID system, so Grandma can't see them when she asks to see your camping photos. 

##### Multiple Scrapbooks
Make as many scrapbooks as you want! One for your trip to the Bahamas, another for a daily journal, and maybe one for all those pictures of your dog that are cluttering your other albums. 

##### Page-Flip, Drag to Rearrange, and Edit
Customize the moments you add and organize them in your scrapbook. Turn the scrapbook's pages to flip through your pictures and comments: update them, or just view them as you recorded it. 

##### Share to Social Media
Share photos straight to Facebook and Twitter from the app, or Air Drop a friend.

### Developer Note

Scrapbooks is a completely free app, with no advertisements, in-app-purchases, subscriptions, up-front fee, or feature restrictions. 

This app is for those who want to keep track of their personal happenings in privacy, from someone who wanted to do the same.
